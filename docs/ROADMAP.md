# Good Vibes Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned modules and sub-components for the Good Vibes single-page application (SPA). It is maintained by **OpenAI Codex** with input from **Claude Code** and **GitHub Copilot**. Changes to this file should reflect the current understanding of project priorities and structure.

## Modules

Each numbered item represents a module of work that can be tracked separately in the repository. Sub-items describe related tasks or components.

### Status Overview

- [x] **Module 1: Core Layout** – Implemented basic HTML skeleton with header, footer, navigation, base CSS, and minimal JavaScript.
- [x] **Module 2: Introduction Section** – Implemented semantic HTML, responsive styling, and placeholder content integrated into the core layout (`66ea2c0`).
- [x] **Module 3: GitHub Repositories Listing** – Static listing with dynamic loading placeholders (`092361b`).
- [x] **Module 4: Articles Section** – Basic list layout with dynamic loading placeholders (`cf0b391`).
- [x] **Module 5: Utilities and Helpers** – Shared JavaScript and CSS helpers (`d26b880`)
- [x] **Module 6: Build and Testing Setup** – Development tooling and automated tests (`afe0fe5`).

1. **Core Layout**
   - Basic HTML structure with header, footer, and central content container.
   - Shared navigation elements for switching between sections.
   - Global styles and variables.
2. **Introduction Section**
   - Content describing vibe coding and the purpose of Good Vibes.
   - Styling rules for headings, paragraphs, and images within this section.
3. **GitHub Repositories Listing**
   - Display placeholder repository cards using semantic HTML.
   - Provide links and brief descriptions for each repository.
   - Include loading and error placeholders for future API integration.
   - Consider caching results or providing a fallback for offline viewing.
4. **Articles Section**
   - Markdown-driven or HTML-based articles about the vibe coding journey.
   - Navigation for multiple articles and an index or landing page.
   - Optionally include syntax highlighting for code snippets.
5. **Utilities and Helpers**
   - JavaScript modules for data fetching, DOM manipulation, or animations.
   - CSS helpers and mixins to keep styling consistent.
6. **Build and Testing Setup**
   - Configuration for development tooling (linters, bundlers, etc.).
   - Automated tests for core functionality.

## Collaboration Roles

- **OpenAI Codex** updates this roadmap and suggests structural changes or new modules as the project evolves.
- **Claude Code** implements the modules, writes tests, and keeps code organized according to the roadmap.
- **GitHub Copilot** reviews pull requests for style and best practices, flagging inconsistencies or areas for improvement.

## Tracking Modules

Each module or sub-component should be tracked as a discrete task. Typical workflow:

1. Codex outlines or updates a module in this roadmap.
2. Claude Code creates or updates source files to implement the module and accompanying tests.
3. GitHub Copilot reviews the commit or pull request for style, clarity, and adherence to project guidelines.
4. Once merged, this roadmap is updated to reflect progress or introduce the next tasks.

Roadmap updates and implementation details should remain small in scope to keep iterations easy to review and merge.

## Lessons Learned

- Employ semantic HTML elements like `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<header>` for clarity and accessibility.
- Keep CSS modular using variables and consistent class names.
- Provide visible focus states for keyboard navigation.
- Design responsive layouts concurrently with desktop styles.
- Use placeholder content and accessible loading/error states when preparing for dynamic data.
- Consider separating section-specific styles into dedicated CSS files as modules expand.
- Plan for dynamic sections early by adding ARIA live regions and retry controls.
- Organize shared utilities in dedicated files to promote reuse across modules.

## Development Cycle Status

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (July 3, 2025)

All six planned modules have been successfully implemented and are production-ready. The development cycle achieved:

- **52 comprehensive unit tests** with 100% pass rate
- **Zero critical linting errors** in JavaScript code
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing
- **36.6% build size reduction** through optimization
- **Complete documentation** including formal retrospective

For detailed analysis of achievements, lessons learned, and Version 2 recommendations, see the [Development Retrospective](../Retrospective.md).

## Version 2 Ideas

Future work could introduce dynamic data loading and broader testing:

- Fetch GitHub repositories and articles from remote APIs with graceful fallback when offline.
- Add end-to-end tests and accessibility audits.
- Integrate a small state management layer for more complex interactions.
- Explore deployment automation and performance monitoring.

## Sprint 2 Plan

A detailed sprint outline for modules 7–12 is provided in [ROADMAP-2.md](../ROADMAP-2.md).
