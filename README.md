# Good Vibes

This is the public repository for [benlive.tv/good-vibes](https://benlive.tv/good-vibes).

**Good Vibes** is a standalone single-page application (SPA) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It serves as an open example of a "vibe coding" project â€” an experimental approach to building web pages that reflect spontaneous, creative coding sessions.

The site includes:
- An introduction to vibe coding and this project's purpose.
- A section listing related GitHub repositories.
- A section for articles about the vibe coding journey, process, and experiments.

## AI Assistance

This project uses a collaborative AI development approach with three dedicated systems:

- **[OpenAI Codex](AGENTS.md)**: Responsible for planning, roadmap management, and high-level project direction.
- **[Claude Code](CLAUDE.md)**: Responsible for writing code implementations and test coverage.
- **[GitHub Copilot](.github/copilot-instructions.md)**: Responsible for reviewing commit diffs and pull requests for consistency and style.

## Project Roadmap

The planning and tracking documents live in the [docs](docs/) directory:

- [Good Vibes Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md)
- [Development Tracking Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING.md)
- [Sprint 2 Plan](ROADMAP-2.md)

These files are updated regularly by the AI agents to keep progress transparent and aligned with the project's goals.

## Development Status
