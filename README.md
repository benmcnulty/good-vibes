# Good Vibes

This is the public repository for [benlive.tv/good-vibes](https://benlive.tv/good-vibes).

It serves as an open example of a "vibe coding" project â€” an experimental approach to building web pages that reflect spontaneous, creative coding sessions.

The site includes:
- An introduction to vibe coding and this project's purpose.
- A section listing related GitHub repositories.
- A section for articles about the vibe coding journey, process, and experiments.
